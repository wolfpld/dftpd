Welcome to the S60 Dumb FTP Server (dftpd)
      THE first Symbian FTP server

Please keep in mind that this server is
highly experimental and by design doesn't
support extravagant FTP commands. You
won't be able to transmit EBCDIC encoded
39-bit byte record-structured files with
telnet format controls in block mode to
your DEC TOPS-20s mainframe. But you will
be able to send and receive photos,
videos, programs, etc.
